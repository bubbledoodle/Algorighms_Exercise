## Question

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

## Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if root == None or root == q or root == p:
            return root
        
        if (p.val <= root.val and root.val <= q.val) or (p.val >= root.val and root.val >= q.val):
            return root
        
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        
        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
```

## thinkings
BST has very good property of sorting. But not being able to think about this hint below:

If p.val <= root.val <= q.val or q.val <= root.val <= p.val, it means root is LCA of p and q.
and you have to convert this idea into code, that is if this happens, return what? if not, meaning either both pq are greater or less than root.val. And think of conduct leaf pushing.
